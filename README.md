Project Summary:
•	GPT-2 model is tuned using a mixture of synthetic optical module data and actual data from Cell Site Router 
•	Model is tuned for learning laser bias current, channel power of the optical module. 
•	The objective is to make a fine-tuned model from GPT-2, that is then distilled and pruned. 
•	The distilled pruned version of model is then quantized to run in 4bit mode in an embedded system with small foot print compute resources. 
•	Last step is to demonstrate an agent answering field technician’s troubleshooting queries.
